A programm to monitor your CPU and RAM usage. It is shown in the Application Bar. (System Tray)

The stats are currently updated every 10 seconds. (Will be configurable in the futur!)

## Getting started

**Warning:** only tested on macOS Version  10.14.2

1. Clone the project
2. Navigate into the project
3. Install modules: `npm install`
4. Package app: `npm run package`
5. App file: `macStats.app` is in the folder: `./macStats-darwin-x64`

Done! 🎉

(You may also drag it into your Applications folder to keep it somewhere so you can find it faster!)
